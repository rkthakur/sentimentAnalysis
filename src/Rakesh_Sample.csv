Managing a happy client and a happy team is a rare thing one would find in any project. Shivani being the account's program manager from offshore handles different issues separately for each brand and yet keeping all of us under the same umbrella (Tapestry). Her planning for managing the bandwidth in each quarter is very commanding. I appreciate your efforts on shuffing the resources across teams so as to avoid dependencies and help your team for their individual growth path.  Keep spreading smiles Shivani :)   
Being new to the technology as well as the project he showed remarkable speed in getting all the context. Was productive in no time and was handling multiple tasks. Has been handling tasks as a pro even when the title was of a Junior Associate. He also took Knowledge sharing sessions for other people when team was expanded being the point man for all internal queries. Such is the confidence that he was preferred to support the UAT of the current project along with a lead rather than a senior person.
"From the last six month  I am working with Sushen. I am impressed with his managerial and leadership skill. Let me share my story why I am nominating him. I was new to SFCC and on my first day of Project  Rakesh Assigned me Production Monitoring and Production Support task. I was not sure that I can complete the task assigned to  me and also worried because this task because it was critical and related to production at same time Sushen understand the situation and told me don't worry I can understand the situation  you are not only responsible for production monitoring and production support but also the team is responsible. This statement encouraged me to take the task and I am happy to work with him. He always takes the decisions very wisely.  He promotes team spirit. In my opinion  he is a true leader.     "
Handling and managing the team is what has made an extra ordinary impact over the team.
"There were QA tasks in the Tickets where she has demonstrated innovation by following testing approach which has made 100% test coverage  as without that it was not possible due to limited time and delivery deadline by client. Also finding observations and reported them quickly was very helpful in quick fix and smooth delivery of the assignment. "

"I have been working with Tanuj for over 3 months and we worked together on a few new business growth opportunities for building SFCC Digital platform and managed services for Yamaha Music India and L’Occitane APAC. What stands out for Tanuj and makes him a worthy candidate for the leadership spotlight award is his ability to quickly understand client needs both stated and unstated in each RFP and play an active role in discussing the solution approach and delivery planning. Responding to RFPs is a highly skilled ask  with each opportunity being significantly different from the previous one. Very few people are able to grasp the unique requirements/business problems and tailor the response accordingly working under tough timelines in most situations. Tanuj has demonstrated this understanding consistently over multiple RFPs and moreover has also and displayed a great attitude in going the extra mile in crunch situations and juggling multiple priorities (current project commitments and new business opportunities) when there has been a need. Both of these qualities make him the right choice for the leadership spotlight award."
"Sapient team started working with Fresh from Sep'18. To start with  we were awarded the Fresh.com current site managed services work and plan was to go for the bigger project in 2019 which is to upgrade the site to SFCC SFRA version. Client wanted to see Sapient’s quality of work  commitment  work ethics on the managed services project before confirming the development project.   Rohit joined the team from start as onshore architect and front facing the client in all technical discussions  issues  questions  clarification etc. In very short span he built strong rapport with client team. He became the go-to person for them to discuss any technical issue. He has very strong Demandware knowledge which helped our team tremendously and it also helped boosting client confidence in our technical capabilities. Following are few specific examples of his contribution:  1.	During the discovery phase of the development project Rohit showed strong expertise of demandware core platform  third party integrations  known pitfalls  and best practices. All of this he explained to the client team in various forums. That helped in getting the discovery project deliverables accepted by client team without any delay or concern.  2.	There were multiple incidents where very tricky problems were found in production. Client team wanted quick solve because these were impacting live orders. Rohit was quick in analyzing such issues and providing solutions. 3.	There were some situations where our team missed to resolve few issues on-time. Rohit was able to explain the rationale and technical complexities due to which delay happened. Client team has strong trust on his technical expertise and that helps a lot in reducing unnecessary noise or escalations.  Overall Rohit has done great work on Fresh account and he should be considered for SFCC rewards and recognition for Q1.    "
