Sanjay worked first time as XT developer in our project. With little guidance he picked quite fast. 
"It is said that ""One of the most important actions   that a leader can do   is to lead by example.If you want everyone else to be passionate   committed  dedicated and motivated   you  go first! "" and that's what is fully exemplified by Sanjay.He is great leader a true guide who always inspires the team to cross the bar and ensures great productivity fromt the team. He understands his Team very well and guide them in right direction.He has been influential throughout the project and also motivates others.The way Sanjay had provided opportunity and flexibility in SGWS project enables QA team to learn & practice automation implementation and results in having 3 automation suits ready in Chai/Mocha  BDD and TDD approaches   enables people growth.It inspires everyone else in the team to deliver high quality work.He is the one who stand by the team when needed the most.He helps every one in the team to learn new things.I got to learn new things regarding functional automation test suite under his guidance so   I think he is able to realize the potential in one and gives opportunity to grow.He is approchable and cordial in situations when we are stuck at some point. He has a clear vision about what needs to be done when and derives the how by ensuring the right set of activities are assigned to right person catering individual's capability utilization to the fullest along with his/her learning and deliver with a relevant buffer time.

I beleive Sanjay possesses excellent analytical  Logical  Technical  management and relationship building skills.It is a great experience in working with him."
"Obsession with broad diversification is the sure road to mediocrity - John Neff   A quote which perfectly matches the dynamic and adaptive personality of Sanjay  My Association with Sanjay has been of about half a year. He joined in as a QA Manager  for which the primary objective is of ensuring the quality product delivered to customers and pushing the team towards effective QA processes/automation . I am nominating Sanjay for Client Impact award because of his absolute diligence and his commitment to make sure that client expectations are met above and beyond. When there was a single QA   overburdened with a lot of work  he ensured not only to pick work on his own   but to spend time and discover issues which were criticals in the project context. Being a manager very less of the population is interested to deep dive and make their hands dirty. Along with that   when the team was struggling to achieve JIRA compliance  he took a step forward and took sessions to educate the team-which later on helped the leadership showcase the Speedy/JIRA Dashboards to the client resulting in the smooth Delivery. He is a manager one could go to and seek a genuine Advice on any personal/professional aspect. Before the project Go -Live Dates   Sanjay motivated his team to focus on Automatons  It was a result of which the entire Function Automation flows were built - the first to be built for an SFRA Project in Sapient  also he encouraged the team to take up on BDD - Behavioral driven development and TDD - Test Driven Development   for which work is in near completion. He Helps his team to diversify  play around and explore the opportunities at hand. It’s an absolute pleasure to see an individual  at this level  striving every day to make sure that his work not only resolves the issues at hand but creates an impact for our clients and its customers. One major quality i see in Sanjay is Diversification   he not only does what is expected but explores the grey areas where one would not put the effort to deep dive in  eventually taking out something which is worth a great value to the Client  examples being Automation of whole test suite case. It was with his dedication   that made it happen. Another Quality prominent in him is Leadership  - He believes in carving out the perfect path in which his team could grow  one such example would be starting with a POC on the automation suite himself before handing it over to his team. He walks the way himself first and then set examples for the others  as rightly said - ""Leadership is practiced not so much in words as in attitude and in actions"". Under his guidance  the majority of team members have learned something new  and they are not afraid to travel an unknown path"
Sanjay is a great QA Manager in Southern Glazer's project .He truly exhibits leadership and People Growth values.He is very detail oriented  very clear and concise in his communication and possesses excellent documentation skills.

There has been times   when no body was clear of the next step regarding deliverables but Sanjay leaded there as well   walked to that road not taken to make sure what we deliver is one of the best . He has shown light to the team .One such supportive leader like Sanjay is mandatory for every team   he is a gem.It has been only 3 months in project Southern Glazers   working in Sanjay's team and I have been in awe of his leadership skills .He has shown that believe in a newcomer like me that has encouraged me to come out with flying colours .He has that quality to provide the team that ease to work collaboratively so that job is done perfectly. I can surely say that whosever had worked with him or works in future   learn something new from him.He is a multi tasker   I have seen him managing all the project work well like setting up process (in Jira   confluence )alongside onshore meetings  demos  his own trainings etc .He has a unique style to work for he will never complain because the person he is working with realises himself that responsibility assigned to him.He is a true mentor   had been a strong pillar behind me   provided me that platform to learn and grow in fast pace .He gives people opportunity to learn   help them grow  provide comfortable environment and encourage team members to innovate

I would like to nominate Vinod for client impact category because of his dedication which made difference many times. One of such instance is - after post launch of smileactives brand we released some post launch items to onshore team and came to know about one quick change which was crucial for business at that time. I was travelling to home at that time and expected to reach after 1.30 hours. Hence  asked Vinod to handle the same who just reached his home and he handled the change and got it verified by QA. Apart from this  Vinod did great job in some of key features of framework including multiple membership  upsell and profile. He developed and managed the multiple membership release with one developer very well within the deadlines. Whenever any task is assigned to him  he puts all his effort to complete that.
Vinod is very calm  cool and enthusiastic person. I found him always ready to support in any possible way.  He is one of them who takes every challenge and deliver it on time.  His never denying attitude is commendable which shows his willingness towards the work he does for successful deliverables like Mountain  SA brand launch and WM launch. With so much passion and enthusiasm towards works and ability to deliver  make him unique and approachable. Wish you all the very best for future endeavor.
Vishal joined the team just threee months back as a frontend developer and he is new to SFCC as well but way he has picked up the things is commendable. We assigned him to complete the batch 1 development of new brand Mally beaty which he completed in before 3-4 days than the actual timeline that too including some additional task and self owned BM configuration. During his initial days after joinning project  he helped QA team in the framework testing during first brand launch on the framework.
I would like to recognize Vishal for his Client Imapct. It's being more than 6 month to work with him in Guthy-Renker project. His ethical behavior  enthusiasm  and commitment towards task accomplishment  are commendable. When He joined Guthy-Renker team was busy to deliver smileactives.com. He help us lot to find p3 and p4 defects. He not even reported defects but fix all those. Thanks Vishal
He did a tremendous job in his track  he alone delivered many sprints that includes all aspects of testing whether Manual   Automation or Mobile testing. 
"Vivek is the backbone of UI development in Guthy-Renker project. The way he takes ownership and leads the UI development track is commendable. He is primarily involved in ""Mountain less framework"" track but there are many instance where he contributed to other tracks based on needs. In WBCD track  security issues were detected due to the old code base of the site and at that time the client was too much worried thinking that he has to upgrade the whole site but there was not sufficient time. But Vivek analyzed the site and upgraded the jQuery library to handle the situation without impacting the functionalities on the site and that too much before the deadline. His SFCC platform knowledge is equally strong which has saved many time for backend end developers at many occasion."
Vivek is very calm  cool and enthusiastic person. I found him always ready to support in any possible way.  He is one of them who takes every challenge and deliver it on time. I do prefer to reach out him first  whenever any gap/issue comes in UI.  With so much passion and enthusiasm towards works and ability to deliver  make him unique and approachable. Wish you all the very best for future endeavor.
He's a stickler for designing pixel perfect websites and encourages and all the people around him to do so as well
Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them. I am taking this opportunity to recognize Shivani Mittal for Leadership and people growth. Her presence itself assures the high moral of the entire team. She is very easy approachable person. She has never shown hesitant in helping to the teams whether she is directly related or not. It is great to see her working and have her as a manager in Coach Project. Her dedication  sincerity and zeal for getting things done  is inspiration for all of us. Thanks Shivani for all the support you are giving to Coach Team. 
Prem has been leading the baton of development from India. His SFCC knowledge has helped the team to deliver 2 major releases without any hiccup.  
Pushker has always been seen doing detailed analysis to a problem and understand the root cause so as to avoid such situations in future. Pushker has been proactive to set up meetings to discuss issues/concerns if any during the project.   I joined this account 6 months back and he had been always supportive of making me understand and become comfortable with the new framework. Also  if it's happened like he wasn't able to address the queries put forward and then at this time  he made sure that the right person is approached to gain the required context. He always has great relations within the team . It is through all of these efforts and hard-work that has made us successful for our clients. Thank you for great work. 
Ritika is dedicated  hardworking and has great team spirit to take up any difficult task. She is single handedly taking care of price related stories in Pandora for all the APAC sites. 
Ritika is new to SFCC world though she has picked things fastly. When the focus in team has shifted to work as full stack   she has also tried to learn css and js
He worked excellent on Bonus product and Checkout implementation. There was lot of work in Bonus product and checkout  He has managed work very efficient in both functionality.  Rohit is the front end developer in our team has shown delivery excellence by giving accurate estimations and timely completion of features and defects.
Single Page Checkout implementation in Coach was left in the middle of development by third party vendor. Sapient picked it up from there. There was lot of work pending in terms of stablising this critical piece of delivery. There were more than 40-50 defects/features scoped in a span of two sprints.  Rohit being the front end developer in our team has shown excellence in delivery by accurate estimations and timely completion of features and defects. His collaborative work attitude helped us reaching the required goal for this project. Keep doing the good work Rohit:)
She follows process by providing the RCA in JIRA defects . Another instance is JIRA DWRE-9772 where she went extra mile to demonstrate  business with the suggested solution by providing the screen shots and getting it closed from the business including mentioning the fix for this defect and other defects as well.  After delivering build to QA she emphasis dev to do a sanity of fixed defects which helps in minimising reopen counter. Would like to recognize Ruchi for CFD as it helps in achieving delivery with quality and within timeline.

I worked closely with Sandeep recently for a brand launch and I've seen him put in the best of him with all the deliverables. He would make even the toughest work seem so easy and also showed leadership skills in taking responsibility of the deliverable and his team. We brainstormed together for many issues that we had for delivering the brand requirements he was innovative to come up with solutions with the least modification in the framework as the client didn't want much modifications in the framework. His contribution has made the framework even better and created impactful deliveries. 
I would like to nominate Sandeep Singh for CFD for his consistent and stellar performance and zeal to learn and contribute to the project progress. Sandeep is a quiet individual who is so focused on his work that he doesn’t even have time to shout about it. He has been a TL of the QA track of MCM team and understands both business and technical aspects well. He is a keen learner and picks up challenging work  making sure that he sees it through finish. He never slips on his delivery and his skills have helped the other team members too very well to ramp up themselves. He is a highly focused individual who has consistently delivered for his team and has always demonstrated exceptional dedication to his work. He has been a very key resource in his module co-coordinating with development team for any challenges faced  at the same time without any effect on his efficiency in all the roles. He has been instrumental in preparing the test packs single handedly  when we faced the resource crunch during analyze phase of the project. 
Sandeep is the core of MCM QA team who is leading the QA track. He takes leadership of the things quite well and always try to deliver the same with perfection. He is always coordinating with each of the team member  ensuring all the assigned task are completed on time. He is a dedicated person with great analytical skills. He always takes the responsibility to track the defects that impact releases and get the delivery teams take actions on the defects. He always takes the responsibility to manage and tracking dependencies that helps the developer to deliver the functionality on time. He is never afraid to roll up his sleeves and take-up the challenging task. He is a multitasker who always there to handle the test case execution  client calls  client demo  defect triage calls and sprint closure reports etc. successfully. He is a silent contributor  always listen to others patiently and resolves the query of other team members in the best possible way. One of a strong pillar of MCM.Keep up good work!!
Sandeep is Mr. dependable for me. Whatever struck in QA at whatever time  if I need someone to work on that the first name comes to my mind is his. Delivering quality is a basic task for professional especially for QA  but reporting the task done and status for the same at right time is much more important. I have never seen any late reports or status from him anytime during this project. His acute eye on miniature details and UI defects is incredible. He truly is a must have in any QA team. He not only delivered what asked for but at the same time he gives idea to do the same in better way. He never hesitates taking additional responsibility. Sandeep is one of the senior most team member in QA team and his knowledge and experience is revealed in his work. He takes leadership of the things quite well and always try to deliver the same with perfection. His approach towards work is very unique. He is a focused person and has an ability to complete the task with quality and on time. He always meets exceed my expectation when it comes to meeting deadlines for anything. He has taken up additional work like QA reporting and BA sync ups very gracefully Sandeep is one man show and always my backup for QA and he is the backbone QA track . Number of task increase or decrease  critical or simple  weekends or weekdays  he keeps on performing and delivering with grace. He is taking care of everything on his own  single handedly and yet gracefully. From P1 P2s to P5 nothing can go off from his keen eyes and in-depth validation. There were instances when I have to convince him drop a defect as it’s only 1-2 px difference and its acceptable  and then post some discussion he drops that Trivial defect. A per whom you don’t have to guide and push for availability. He is flexible  hardworking  enthusiastic & passionate towards his work. Sandeep is a proactive and responsible person in MCM Global QA team. He is fully aware of all QA process and completely believes in delivering the quality work. Though he is a silent contributor but he has an amazing sense of humor. In MCM Global  he is the one who has immense knowledge of scope matrix and always helps the team in understating the scope of the project. Sandeep has a right balance of calmness  empathy and logic to come out with positive relationship across the team. Sandeep has been critical to facilitating meetings  managing and tracking dependencies and continues to find ways  through his strong relationship  to integrate the ways of working between the two entities. One of the many such instances is Defect Triage Call in which he is interacting with TLs and leading from the front on resolving the issues. He plays a critical role in bridging sapient communication within the team and TL alignment
Sanjay has been the torch-bearer of adopting best practices and processes in SFCC COE. He has been managing QA tracks on multiple accounts very well without compromising the delivery quality on any track. He is a great leader and has provided appropriate guidance to all team members regarding QA related activities and JIRA processes. His concepts are very clear when it comes to identifying the ways of working within the team. He has developed good rapport with the client. Thanks to his efforts  team has been able to ramp up very fast. 
“Stars do not pull each other down to be more visible; they shine brighter.” This goes true for Sanjay Negi. He is the youngest person in the MCM Project but his impact and contribution in team is really high.  His strong aptitude always helps team to find out the hidden bugs in application. When he joined the team  MCM was live and he found new defects in the application. Almost everyone in the team appreciates his innovative way of testing. I remember an incident where he found a defect on checkout page related to credit card  when user enters the incorrect credit card details and submit it  the billing page of checkout got disappear. This was really a good catch. He always surprise the development team by his unique combination of scenarios which breaks their coding logic and they always think through to build a better quality system. Sanjay is very sincere towards his work and any work assigned to him  he take complete responsibility of it and completes it with enthusiasm. He is always keen to learn to new things. Its pleasure working with him. He is a really an asset to team. Keep rocking Sanjay !!
I would like to recognize Sanjay for Client Focus Delivery. He has a very focused Attitude towards delivering a Quality product for the client.

Saurabh joined our project few months back and very soon he took over major qa work. He is excellent at his work
"I would like to nominate Shallu for her great work in Guthy-Renker project. Be it ""Mountain less"" track or ""Facebook Marketing Campaign"" track she has performed well in all. The recent story to define her dedication  commitment and great work is Westmore brand launch. Initially  two different QA were aligned in Westmore project and during crucial phase both had to go on long leave due to personal reasons. At that time  She came into project and helped us in timely and smooth delivery of the project by using her experience and reporting all issues on time. She worked around 16 hours during Westmore brand DNS cut over. Apart from this  Onshore team has praised her for great support during ETE testing of Smileactives brand which indirectly helped third parties(Order hub and fulfillment center)."
I've not seen anyone as good as Shallu in testing anything and everything regarding the deliverables. She takes ownership of her task and shows leadership qualities to lead her team to find out all the major and minor issues before client delivery. I've worked with her in more than 2 brands and her work has been awesome. She would put in great efforts with ease and catch the major defects that were missed by the developers and would have created a negative impact if delivered. She would understand the clients demand properly and has good understanding of user experience. I feel that the launch of 2 brands yet  were stable because of her great contribution.
Shilp has been an integral part of the TPC team. No matter how complex the requirements  she thinks through and comes up with smart solutions. She always manages her work on time  raises risks and issues on time and also never shies away from doing the same. She is not only a hard worker but a smart worker and always amazed us and client with her creativity. Keep rising Shilp!
I would like to Nominate Shivam for making an impact in Smileactives brand launch which was the first brand on Mountain less framework we developed for client. One of the key feature of framework is Kit Customization. During bug fixing when we assigned Kit Customization related issues to Shivam  he not only fixed them rather pointed out some more defects in that functionality which were not easily catchable and solved them without taking additional time. Apart from this  even after not feeling so comfortable in first full stack assignment  he emerged as a reliable full stack developer after his descent work in Mallybeaty and Crepeerase brand campaigns. He always looks for learning and whenever he is not having much work I have seen digging into some unsused feature of ecommerce/sitegenesis. In his recent assignment on Crepeerase  he worked till late night just to meet the timeline he commited to us and we came to know this next day.
Being one of the new member in GR and new to functionality as well  he has shown tremendous zeal to learn & rise above this barrier in shortest span of time. I would like to recommend Shivam for Client Impact. He is one of the most dedicated and hard working professional I have come across. Very effectively manage his assigned task. His willingness towards the work he does for successful deliverables like Westmore and Mountain is commendable. Keep up the good work.
Shivani is an intelligent developer in MCM project. She is a simple and amazing person whom everyone wants to work. She is meeting the expectations of everyone in the team.  She always ensures the delivery of project on time with good quality. She is proactive in raising the queries and dependencies on time after analyzing the functionality which is really commendable. She is always ready to take any changeling technical issues and delivers it with quality. She holds strong work ethics. When team approaches her for any problem  she understands the full context very calmly and investigate the impact and provide the solution. She always adopt a very systematic approach to resolve any technical issue. She is only one in team who is doing the job monitoring from a long time and her never complaining nature makes her shine like a star in team. Her impact on the project is solid. She maintains the healthy and positive atmosphere in the team. It’s really wonderful to work with her. MCM team is blessed to have a peer like her. 
Shuchita has grown leaps and bounds when I see her journey from few months. She is one of the most hardworking  honest and flexible person when it comes to productions support delivery. The most amazing skill/quality in her is ownership  strong technical skill and knowledge in depth for technology. She has showcased and proved her skills every time in Coach Project. Leadership has a great confidence in her that if any task is assigned to her it will be completed with excellence and within the time frame (let it be project specific or initiatives). She is a core member of Coach Managed Service project. Truly speaking  I think she is doing a tremendous job given her experience in SFCC is just 1 year. Her contribution is unparalleled. Keep up the spirits high. 
When I started in Coach support  the QA team was from QAInfotech (some other third party vendor). Shweta joined us in outlet capital project as QA. The way she handled QA account at that point of time is commandable. In a short span of time  she made a deep understanding around the functionalities in coach. Be it a evening build  she was always there to make sure sanity done properly. Her versatility help us shuffing her with other brands as well. She is hardworking  focused  damn professional about her work.  We end up having a big QA account which started with small impressions made by her team. Hats off to you Mam :)

One thing I really admire about her is that she always try to learn herself and comes up with a solution.

I always like her attitude towards work and team. If any project have a person like Shweta in the team  success of project is assured. It’s wonderful to have a friend like her.
Surbhi has shown great expertise in end to end knowledge of ecommerce platform. She is able to learn new topics very fast. She takes lead in technical implementation on the project and supports team members whenever needed. She is open to feedback and reaches out to appropriate people whenever there is any roadblock for her or anyone on the team.
If you are setting up a new account then Sushen is the bestest person for this role. Very innovative in terms of introducing new process and making sure that these are followed at each level and at each stage of the project lifecycle. Clients love to work with him as they do not have to ask for the reports or status. Everything is automated whether it is JIRA report  release notes  RAID tracker. You name it he will have it.  
Tarun has always being a goto person for any UI related help. Once when I was overloaded with work with too many work in pipeline  even being from another team he stepped forward to help. Tarun is really a good team player
Apart from her brilliant technical and functional prowess there are so many qualities that one can learn from her – leadership skill  commitment to her craft  Multitasking ability  speaking her mind  being aware and taking ownership at all instances are to name a few. She has an inherent energy that drives her do the best possible work she does. To have a leader like mansi is extremely encouraging because she leads by example.

Arun - is an intelligent and most reliable developer in Southern Glazers (SGWS )project. His soft and calm nature makes him shine in team. He is a key person of SGWS team who contributed a lot in implementation of the most important  crucial and complex part of any eCommerce site – CHECKOUT  Feeds & Payment gateways being new to SFCC. He is always ready to pick up any adhoc task and his never complaining nature makes him unique in team. Not only  dev team  even QA folks approach him for any queries without hesitation and he patiently listens to everyone and helps everyone to DELIVER ON TIME with QUALITY. I really admire his for quality work and simplicity. He has happily accepted to take the most challenging part of the project and is building himself to own that piece.

Bhvanesh has done tremendous work across the tracks in Guthy-Renker. His QA skills have been used in many projects depending upon the need. The recent example of his work is Westmore brand launch where he joined us in crucial phase of project when launch date was approaching but the assigned QAs were not available due to long leaves for personal/medical reasons. This is when he helped us in timely and smooth delivery of the project by using his experience. Also  officially he was not assigned for night shift to support Westmore launch but as a sense of responsibility he provided voluntarily support in post production testing from home in midnight.
I would like to recommend Bhavnesh for Client Impact. He is one of the most dedicated and hard working QA professional I have come across. Despite crunched project timelines he completed end-to-end application testing  and exceeded expectations far beyond. This is just a few accolades  you deserve much more. Keep up the good work.

One of the most strong qualities I saw in him is  he has never ever let the things go without being it addressed with right expectation by the right stakeholders. He brings in right focus to the top issues according to the project situation and demand across the board. Quality is never an accident  it is always the result of high intention  since effort  intelligent direction and skillful execution  it represents the wise choice of many alternatives.

Girish is a confident man with great enthusiasm for work and played a vital role in the Westmore Beauty brand launch on Mountain framework. Prior to this project we looked at Girish primarily as a backend resource only but the way he delivered the UI rich most complex requirement of the brand i.e. SAS page it changes our opinion on his capabilities and he gained confidence of senior team members. I think he is a succes story of SFCC full stack training program becuase he worked as a full stack developer in Westmore brand since beginning and as an only developer in last stage of the project. Apart from this  he always looks for innovation - For instance As a part of brand implementation we do a feed validation task(received from external systems) for client to identify if the feed is correct in all respect(syntax  requirement  logical relation  architecture point of view) for consumption of framework. There are plenty of parameters on the basis of which the feed is evaluated. Girish came to me and our project architect with idea to automate this to maximum extent and parallely working on this using node Js and angular. It was utilized for basic level information of received feed and in progress as of now still want to highlight his intent.
Girish has been very helpful when I joined the team and afterwards as well.
His continuous efforts and hard-work have been fruitful to our project GR.He has been helpful to every team member right from the beginning.He motivates everyone and has impacted our project in positive way.
I would like to recognize Girish Mehta for his Client Impact. He was backend developer but recently he got training for full-stack developer.

Kanishk is very focused person. I worked with him on support track and he guided me best as he can. He always think about the how client can grow there business . 
Kanishk Khatter - has been indeed a true face of Pandora APAC from last few months. A true Super-Man who came from onsite and joined Pandora from Day 1 and pick up the Arch role with his knowledge and logical thinking. I wonder what would have happened to Pandora Project if Kanishk would not have been there!!! Kanishk creatively found ways of improving the overall Stability of Pandora APAC application which helped in raising the BAR of Sapient in front of PANDORA APAC clients. I do not think that even he missed reviewing each and every line of code. Irrespective of time before the code moves to integration environment  he ensured the code is being reviewed by him. All user journey’s has been catered. Kanishk excels in managing our teams and our clients. Not only is he an effective architect and team leader  he has taken the skills that he has perfected in working with his own set of problems and expanded his vision to be a thought leader 
Kapil joined the Southern Glazer’s DTC e-Commerce program as a XT architect in Aug 2018. He led the UI development in the DTC project. He worked very closely with the developers in the team by providing design and code level coverage. Kapil diligently and consistently performed detailed PR / code reviews and enforced compliance to well established coding standards. At multiple occasions he found discrepancies such as duplicities  spacing/padding issues  aspect ratios etc.  in the visual designs provided by the designers and enforced them to fix it. Kapil also provided recommendations to the designers towards aligning to mobile layouts first. All the above measures resulted in delivering a clean and responsive UI to the client in a short span of time. Stringent code reviews resulted in minimal UI defects. Kapil groomed green developers into new UI frameworks and technologies enabling them to deliver stellar results  thereby demonstrating client focused delivery and people growth. He is the go-to person in the team for any kind of UI issues. The team looks up to him as a hands-on XT architect who can provide solution to variety of problems.
Impact for a client begins on how well we deliver the demos and then SIT/UAT. Take any project and the story is same for Kapil. Movado  Southern glazers or MCM  we start a project with shortage of UI guys. This time with lots of struggle and people on loan we started yet another project MOVADO. Project with shortest deadlines and lot many customizations ONLY 6 Weeks of development. Projects were in initial sprint and we had 1 UI folks and no hope of getting rest. Despite of major staffing challenges Kapil held the HTML front so well and reviewed Visual Designs/PRs diligently to keep us on track for Sprint builds and goals. Slowly and gradually we keep on loaning the folks from other projects for weeks allocation. It was his level of involvement that helped his team also start getting productive in every sprint and we shined in all our demos with the client. He partners well with the immediate peers (PM/Arch/QA) and also infact owned the first demo. This left a great impression with the client on what we are delivering  without them coming to notice of the staffing challenges. Interacting with client and closing design & approach and providing the info to the team  needed an uptime in office from 9am to 8pm for first all sprints  and Kapil made that investment to now help us all reap the benefits of the same. He remains hands on to help steer code and look & feel conversations. He keeps JIRA up to date helping everyone to give clarity on completion and upcoming tasks. Kapil is a must have in any project and proved himself as a strongest pillar of SFCC UI track.

I have worked with Kunal in Southern Glazers and again we are in the same team   Movado .In SWGWS  Kunal had played  a crucial part of the team and its pleasure to work with him. He is  passionate and talented  diligent enough and his quality work proves his dedication towards it.

He is a great team player. I am sure the way he is outperforming will lead him to success soon and he will definitely come through flying colors.
Working with Kunal on Southern Glazers Project was a nice experience. He has immense talent of highly focused analysis & low bug count development of all stories/tasks he undertakes  he has been primary owner of commerce stories like – Checkout  Cart & payment - for all the functionality he crafted  he has put in his best efforts with quality implementation. He is very matured to work beyond his title.

He is person who has great zeal of looking forward for lot of new things & learning. Apart from work  by his jolly and fun loving attitude towards life  he makes the team's morale is up and everybody in team is jelled up together which has helped the project to go smooth in terms of delivering the milestones.

After changing the members i.e Backend lead project architect in project  I noticed multiple times shilp comes up with great responsibility and new ideas and approaches  for each story/Task and help each and every team memberin their respective works as well.She always delivers a quality work. Keep up the great work!
There were Development tasks in the Tickets where she has demonstrated innovation by simplifying the functionality for the usability and testability. This is appreciable as simplifying is great which helps to maintain the code in terms of enhancements by the next developer and on the other hand helps QA to test it thoroughly and easily.
Once there was production issue  although it was minor but severity was high. She fixed and merged the code which was going live the very next day without creating panic.
I know Shivangi from the last 6 months since i joined WBCD project and she has shown examplanary leadership qualities by ensuring not only on time delivery of tickets with quality but also going an extra mile to lead the track by taking complete ownership of the deliverables and helping / motivating  peers to bring the best out of them . Shivangi has a knack of taking challenges and going extra mile to achieve targets as evident by her unparralled commitment to WBCD track wherein she has evolved as a leader and single point of contact who knows in and out of the project and is prompt to raise risk / challenges on time to avoid failures. I have seen her consistently taking responsibilities like planning   reporting and team mentorship . Overall she is on good candidate who could lead a track and be trusted blindly.
Bhawana has always went extra miles to deliver her work effectively
She is extremely focused and dedicated to her work and deliverables. She exhibits capabilities of an experienced professional. She is committed towards her work and shows commendable zeal to nurture and outshine. As a proactive team member  she always reaches out to respective Dev team member to understand the complex functionality before testing. Her commitment to quality  dedication towards works and hard work is really appreciable. 
Feeling immense proud by sharing feedback of Pawan who is true example of this nomination category Client Impact. I got chance to work with Pawan just three months back but within short span   He amazed by his dedication  domain & platform knowledge to me. One of the most strong qualities I saw in him is he has never ever let the things go without being it addressed with right expectation by the right stakeholders. He brings in right focus to the top issues according to the project situation and demand across the board. He excels at communicating. On delivery side  he is equally intensive and never lets a thing goes missing.   Pawan has been a pillar to the account since he started his stint with Marks and Spencer for around a 8 months back now(Heard from other members and business as I joined just three months back ). This year has been a roller coaster ride for the account who had almost made up their mind to walk away from Publicis.Sapient  towards a different partner  this is a great come back and  Pawan played key role to deliver project on time and without major issues. We went live this Wednesday and cutover activity was planned from Tuesday 8:30Am India time and to start activities   He came to office 3:30AM GMT and stayed there till late night for smooth cutover. Hard Work put by Pawan  will nurture Publicis.Sapient relations with Marks and Spencer. Keep up the good work Pawan!!!
To say that Prem is techinically phenomenal will be injustice to him. He is one of those who believes in not just individual growth but also in the growth of people around. There has been many instances where he has made sure to share from his vast area of knowlegdge with others ( I am among one of those ). For any product release we all freeze a plan  but Prem prepars back up plans. He is the silent soldier of the team he will make sure Sapient impacts on client is never bothered and never take the credit for it. Some of the stars on his cap are amazing time management  team management   innovation and above all being assertive without loosing his temper. There is alot more to Prem then just being the ideal performer. He is a friend and a guide which he is rare to find in the competive world. Its ethics and integrity first rest everything follows. All the best Prem.

Have seen Sushen in both roles ; may it be leading SFCC or leading Pandora. Both places he has marked his own value. He is one leader who is down to earth  modest   always happy to help. As his team is sitting next to us  you can always see his leadership and learn something new all the time. The way he has created the team and grew everyone and also earned the respect and value from this client is known to all. His leadership contribution is not limited to handling and running the project so well; but also extending his help to everyone to the best way he can. Thanks for your guidance always Sushen!
Sushen  You have always been a good leader carrying  all attributes of it. Calm and composed  it creates a great work environment when you takes participation in making things go easy for everyone with your inputs.  Keeping eye on everything even on the minor updates and creating the friendly environment in the team area so everyone finds themselves comfortable  that everyone tries giving their best in business have been impressive. It has been good journey so far under your umbrella
Sushen has been a true leader to our team in every sense. He motivates us and help us to improve our capabilities. He also comes to rescue whenever team needs him.
Babita has been able to pick up a number of stories on very wide aspects of the application. She reaches out to appropriate people for her stories and takes them to closure. She juggles stories well and can manage her time well.
Baldev joined the project when we did not have any other QA tester on the project and has picked up testing very fast. Even in the situation when there have been many stories in the testing backlog  he has been able to flex his skills. As a result  QA track has never been behind  despite aggressive delivery timelines.
Bhanuj is a very fast learner and a very open person when it comes to accepting feedback. He joined the SFCC COE recently after platform training. However  within a very short span of time he has developed into a full-fledged developer and can pick up any part of the functionality. He needs minimal supervision or guidance. He has successfully been delivering stories on time and has often picked up stories from queue of other team-members so that any risk of story completion can be mitigated and overall delivery can be completed at the earliest. Surely he is a great asset to the team.
Anindita has been working as QA in Bare Managed Service Team for one year now. Anindita is allocated in 50% two brands Bare(US UK FR DE)  and Buxom(US). Buxom is one of the critical brand where business looks for oppurtunity to have escalations whatever minor the reason is. However  Anindita manages the quality of Bare and Buxom brand so well that Buxom converted her to full 100% allocation from 50% allocation. Her testing quality is always at par and she makes sure all the possible scenarios works properly whenever a JIRA comes to her for QA. Even Business and Onshore also praised about her which  further set the bar high for other QA's. 
My nominee brings strong assets to his role and our group is incredibly fortunate to have him as our Manager Technology. First  He is dedicated and hardworking. He is extremely organized and focused on continuously learning and developing  best practices to manage routine activities both efficiently and effectively. He brings a positive high energy.
Avinash has a good quality to understand client's demand and providing a best solution. That i felt when i was needed to provide a solution to LLBean Client. Even Avinash is not part of the project but he continously observe my work and gives me feedback for improvement.
I would like to appreciate all the hard work which our team has done since last 3 years for BareMinerals account.  It is because of your hard work and commitment we have been at this place.   We were on the verge of closing the account but due to this team we have not only earned more work from client but we have won the trust as well.  Whether it is a case of monthly release or for helping project teams deliver transformational work this team has shown tremendous enthusiasm in solving most complex problems.  A big thanks to the entire team.   
Wordlpay reported that ome of their prestigious customer is holding the Go-Live becasue they have found some security flwas in worldpay plugin and Elavarasan Natarajan has identified quickly took this challenge identified the issue in worldpay API response and he quickly suggested a logical change in the plugin based on API response.

I have worked with Gaurav in MJ-SFRA project. All I can say is  in the team he is that one go to person for any technical queries. His profound knowledge about critical functionalities helped the team in smooth delivery. I have never seen Gaurav getting panicked even in serious circumstances. His calm and composed nature makes him that leader of the team  who is loved and appreciated by any member in SFCC team. He is a great mentor and a true leader. Thanks a lot  Gaurav.
"Team lead of a project which is first of its kind  a site revamped on new SFCC SFRA architecture. Gaurav has always been a person we look up to as a friend  a guide and also someone who has your back when you messs up something in the project. He is one of the best team leads a team can work under. Understanding an entirely new architecture  building and guiding the team under him and asuring everyone gets the growth they deserve  all the signs a leader should have. Making a project go-live with full client satisfaction and alost zero defects and also making making the team ready for any other SFRA projects surely puts him under the well deserved ""leadership spotlight""."
"LL Bean over the years has mostly been a project where an individual contributor was required. At most times its just one person on the project. So its a tricky situation since  you are the only one on the project and need to take care of a lot of things yourself including develpoment  project management and sometimes even QA.  This role over the years was mostly taken up by an architect. We had to put Himanshu in such a role and he had big shoes to fill in that he has done successfully with accolades from clients. His delivery exellence and taking care of clients requirements come what may and in any kinds of situations has won him immense client appreciation and also built trust on Sapient.  one client accolade that I have recieved recently from clients praising Himanshu for his work:  ""We would like to send Himanshu a little care package from LLBean to thank him for all of his hard work and dedication. Would you happen to know his shirt size - we would like to get him a shirt."""
Karthick has been delievring  the SFCC World pay cartridge per standards and also groom /mentor Nishikant and Sonal Associates  to be developers of great quality. This is seen in how nishikant has  grown up  in World pay and SONAL is doing in Shiseido GIARAN project
Murthy is promising guy. He is extraordinary resource  I personally feels he is great asset to our project
Takes owner ship of Fresh Support and delivers extraordinary output  
He has worked on almost all part of project and has been a go to person for everyone in team.
Being a fresher he quickly learnt the SFCC framework within few weeks. He is very hard working and always try to improve / maintain the code quality even after completing the tasks assigned to him. I remember in Marc Jacobs project he worked on PDP and lot of backend customizations on it  so even after verifying the functionality and get it approved from QA  he used to spend extra hours to improvise the code for better performance which is really commendable. He has amazing analytical skills to resolve any code issues.
Marc Jacobs is his first project he knows how to balance learning along with delivering quality work. He is very dedicated towards his work and always follow complete process. He is having good encourage team members to work with more diligently as he also own the quality. He used to handle complex situation with cool nature and resolve the issue. He always ready to work on the new initiative. Your dedication and sincerity towards client focus delivery is remarkable. Apart from his technical skills for which he is well known in the project  he is always up and ready to extend helping hand to others And the best part  always calm and focused  whatever the situation be. Wish you a lot of success ahead Keep up the good work!!
"This guy joined Sapient straight out of college (fresher) but showed no signs of being a rookie. Although he was the youngest member in the team   his hard work and dedication had really helped us out during our project launch. MJ was the one of the first projects in Sapient to develop (revamp) the site on SFRA architecture and Madhu showed immense dedication to quickly learn the concepts and apply them seamlessly in all the stories assigned to him. But he is no Jack who is all work and no play. He actively took part in all team events and me being one of the coordinator of the fun team  he would always ask me about next team events or parties and how can he help. Last but not the least  he is ""soldier level"" disciplined which I believe is a magnificent quality for a team member and an inspiration to all fellow colleagues. He just dsnt have a ""winner’s attitude""..he is already a winner!"
Madhusudan joined Marc Jacobs account during our SFRA implementation as a trainee.  In a short span he has gained good context of Marc Jacobs site and has worked on almost all the modules  as part of managed services track.  He shows great interest in learning new things and always reaches out to seniors in the team to give him more work  once he's done with his assigned task or whenever he is blocked due to any dependencies.  He thinks through all the scenarios when ever he develops something or fixes any defect  which shows in the qulity of his deliverable. Happy to have him in the team.
Madhusudan was a key member in MJ SFRA project delivery. Being an associate  his quick learning skills and understanding of requirements made the project delivery smoother. He has delivered many critical modules efficiently. His flexibility about working hours can not be sidestepped  he remained available over weekends and late nights to ensure timely delivery of different modules. Thank you Madhu  for all the great work.!!
Madhu is very dedicated and sincerity towards his work. Always ready to help others. Never hesitate to work beyond working hours when it is required. 
The resource has consistently maintained great communication with a whole brand's client and shown tremendous effort in explaining the technical details in depth. His hard work and commitment is visible in each day's work . Inspite of his short time in sapient (1 year)   his dedication and buisness approch has shown much more maturity in every agile releases. He has also been recognised by project mates for exceptional work in a single release. I am pleased to nominate him for this much deserving award
I would like to nominate Umesh for Delivery Excellence and Leadership Spotlight. He is the coolest and calm Architect who doesn't need any noise to be recognized  but one who does his work and assists others in such a seamless way  which is an extra-ordinary trait. He takes ownership not just for dev track but for all QA testing scope areas as well and does the job brilliantly. For each issue anyone in the team might face  he has at least more than 2 solution approach to that. He inspires every team member to perform at their best. It was really a very good experience working with you and leading a QA team for your deliverable. Your consistent approach to make sure QA team has right knowledge to test the new integrations like Vertex and Sterling are really commendable. Without your guidance SBCR QA team would have failed to SIGN OFF critical features like Sterling OMS and Vertex for Go Live.  Thanks a lot for all the great work you have done for SBCR dev and QA team.
Vimal is one of the most valuable also reachable/go person in QA team for any issues under any modules  most of the complex modules validated by Vimal and will make sure all impact areas are covered during the testing.   Many times he was challenging the way business rules / requirement are being designed  & he gave suggestion/correction to product owner. He was solving queries from client QA team & make sure they understood well. Many days he stayed back office late night & meeting with product owner & He guided & helped product owner to do smooth client Demo. He was solving all the queries from Dev team whenever they need & also given walk through of requirement / wire frame whenever there is any new requirement. Through Test case review call  he explained all the test cases & make sure client team understood all the scenarios.   He always think from End user perspective  (for example) During the triage call with client  he told that it is good to have lazy loader at the bottom of the page  otherwise customer may not know whether any products are there down below & client was happy with his suggestion & it came as a new requirement in next sprint  Beyond his role  He spent time for taking interviews to get quality resource for other SFCC projects. He spent time for creating Deck for product owner to give Demo
Vivek joined the Shiseido Canada QE Team during sprint 2 and has been very organized and a dedicated member of the team. He has displayed maturity and consistency in his work. Again  you do not have to follow up with him  he will ensure that he completes all the tasks assigned to his on time. He will go extra mile to ensure the things are moving and will keep the team posted on the progress. He is always eager to help team members. Vivek’ s perfect attitude of not moving forward with assumptions unless things are clarified made him a successful QE. His contribution in several round of E2E testing for Canada brands were amazing. He has maintained himself as one of the top tester in the team be it test case execution  be it defect retesting  be it helping other team members. He is one of the tester who definitely make the difference in the team. Vivek  you are our STAR and doing a great job. Keep it up. I am you Fan now!!
Yashi has been in SFCC for a long time and has worked on multipe projects previously. She has had fair share of challenges in the past but the way she has been able to turnaround her weakness to become her strength is remarkable. In last 1-1.5 year she has picked up pace from developing minor changes to leading Mini-Projects  mentoring team members to client communication.  An example of the turn around is a security project PX. She was part of the design phase of this project lead by an Senior Associate being done for multiple L'Oreal brands. And in a months time she build such a strong understanding that she went on to leading the design for remaining brands. She  took up the client communication as well for this being the single point of contact from offshore along with handling communication with the third party provider - PX(based in Isreal) to independently have the challenges identified and resolved working closely with them. The client team also had good feedback for the project. Amazing to see her realize her potential and at the same time add value to the project.
Fullstack Dev who owns the entire SDLC life cycle of laura mercier

Yougall was very good in handling all performance ticket for LM. The suggested solution was full proof and created the performance improvement and had positive impact with Clients. 
He is great leader with extra ordinary leadership quality
I've worked with Abha for one brand and I've seen her take up responsibility for the task she gets. She would put in extra efforts after office hours for her learning and better delivery to the client. In a short span of time she became comfortable with tasks that many in team find it hard to get comfortable with. Any task tough enough would be just like another challenge for her that she takes up and does all the learning and efforts that she has too and completed the task on time. 
Aditi was new to SFCC as well as the project when she joined us last year. The journey from there on has been that of a pro. She has been part of a couple of Mini-Project and has been able to deliver with quality consistently. Ex- Calabrio and DDM. Both these projects are critical for client team and time sensitive as well. With limited transition she was able to understand the knitty-gritties of the project. She is able to come up with solutions when faced with challenges rather than get blocked by them. She went down delivering within the stipulated timelines and with excellent quality. Keep up the good work  Aditi.
In day to day life  he manages the team along with he equally contribute in technical aspects  moreover his passion to learn new things and his innovation ideas makes everyone to proud.
Amrita joined Pandora as a BA and played a role of BA QA  Product Owner. Since we sit close to Pandora area  I have always seen her leading and driving things. I have always observed her taking complete responsibility and ownership; when Sushen is not around. She has been doing wonderful job in her domain as well as leading things in a beautiful manner. I infact once suggested her getting into PM domain :) Great going Amrita! 
A positive attitude comes from your knowledge. Amrita have that Positive attitude to do things in a wiser manner. She is an all-rounder  not just a Business analyst or OMS-developer She don't have any technology bars. I wants to nominate Amrita for relationship also  She knows very well how to break the ice with all alone  whenever there was a silence She was the one who make whole team Smile which spread a positive environment in team area and created an environment of openness. It was my pleasure to work with you  your guidance helps me a lot to acquire new skills required in the corporate world.
Amrita  You had been a great asset to  SFCC  having understanding of OMS  Ecommerce  and business Consulting domain  you have been a go to person for any inputs that I look up to as being new to SFCC. On the very first day I was introduced to SFCC  you were mentor for me to get settled quickly. Long ramp-up sessions   Explaining workflows   answering all my question/queries in parallel of your own works  you have managed things really well. You sets an example of client impact as well  the work you do have been appreciated from all stakeholders as well as from us.  Happy to see you growing on professional front . Good luck  !
Anisha is a great QA Lead to have on a project team  She is highly adaptable  very detail oriented  very clear and concise in his communication and possesses excellent documentation skills. Anisha has always been dedicated towards the on-time delivery of all the assignments. She has deep understanding of quality standards with focus on delivering business solutions and churn out critical defects in almost all the releases. She has also introduced various quality standards and processes in the project which has helped teams phasing out critical defects in various stages of the project. When I joined MCM Global project  Anisha has helped me to learn and scheduled training for me on. Her trust on team always boot team members. Her commitment towards work is commendable. 
I worked with Anisha in MCM project and want to nominate her for Leadership  she shows great commitment for Team as well as Delivery and maintains a great balance between them. Her capability of handling multiple tasks at the same is just awesome  I have seen her working on her task  having discussions with developers  working with team  all at the same time and extremely efficiently. She many times performed as the only point of contact with the clients and delivered the release notes and tickets on time. She many times delivered the tickets single handedly to the clients from development environment to the production. She is also very friendly in nature and maintains very good relationship with Team. She is very sound in QA  which showed her work in the project. Great work Anisha. 
She is a good leader and she tries team to be together
Anmol has joined Sapient around a year back. A very usual person - Very much casual  Keep smiling  find him anywhere with no seriousness.  As I started interacting  I realized his attitude towards commitment. Seeing his attitude to learn anything and level of commitment  we gave responsibility to lead a small track which was support track which work on old relm. Last month client challenged us for new business (additional revenue) for new relm work where we did not have additional resource. As this was business opportunity  we talked to Anmol if he would like to make an attempt. He surprised us that he has already learnt new relm R4 with other teammates as his personal interest. He took the challenge to another level. He added a new person from outside project and got the work delivered with almost no defect. He is a true Rookie who can be trusted blindly for delivery.
Anmol Srivastava is a self-oriented person and always ready to learn new technology. He was nominated for full-stack training and he is now working as full-stack developer in the team. He is keen to learn different Salesforce technology viz. Sales Cloud  Service Cloud  Marketing Cloud etc. and has basic understanding of them. He is new to SFCC and is performing well and also handling queries of his juniors to a good extent. Along with decent technical skills  Anmol too has leadership skills. People in GR team seek him for a solution. He has been leading FB track (Guthy Renker) since past 9 months  with minimal involvement of senior members of the team. The testing team is confident enough on the work/resolution Anmol has delivered. The onshore team members agree mostly for the timelines and the quality work delivered by him. He also has understanding of e-commerce domain to a fair extent. 
Anuj jain has been the key pillar of every project that he has worked in. Not only is he very strong on technology  he is also always very helpful and supportive to all team mmebers. He is one of the first people to come to office and often the last on eto leave. team feels energised by his presence and leadership. he sits with every developer who needs any help and provides guidance till the person is confident. As a result developers are motivated to deliver with 200% commitment
Bharat has very good knowledge of Salesforce commerce platform. I have moved to SFCC after cross skill training from WCS to SFCC and joined Coach TBM project as a developer. He is working in this project as a lead. As recently moved into SFCC  I need to take help in technical problems. He is always ready to help and never tired of technical questions which sometimes arises in technical approach. He is most knowledgeable team member of my account and could not find any technical issue so far which he could not resolve and help me out. I would also like to mention that he is very patient and calm even if we had tight deadline to complete work and quick to find good approach to develop code which is optimized and adhere to best practice.
She is a silent performer and has been delivering consistently since she joined Pandora.
You have shown impressive impact on our FB track. From the last some campaign deployment  you have taken complete ownership of development & deployment and created a Rookie image in our track. It's really appreciated.
Garima Negi is like pocket bomb  small but lethal. She is an QA AL2 and southern glazers was her first project in Sapient. Very new to Sapient  completely unaware of the processes and ways of working  I assumed her to be a average performer. But I did underestimated her. She is too good  too talented for her current role and experience. She joined the project with lots of questions and queries  as a QA manager of the project I explained her once. But everyday she use to come up with new set of questions and queries  this give a feeling that she wants to learn whatever is possible in her scope. She was taken as a manual QA and she asked me for helping her in learning automation using selenium Test NG. I explained and guided her on how to go about learning the same. She start her learning journey in selenium and at the same time dedicatedly working towards the success of the project. She proved to be a critical resource in the team  with maximum number of defects logged. She is very focused towards the quality and raised her concerns and issue well in time. She has Peculiar skills in getting the things done in no time. She thinks through various scenarios and comes up with unique scenarios and combinations thus breaking the logic built in  as a result challenges the developers to think through and build a better quality system. Surprising story comes to me when she setup up a meeting to review the automation suite  in a shortest span of time she has created a nice automation TDD framework and automated 30% of the application. That was Jaw dropping for me  learning at great pace and delivering the same was AWESOME. By the closure of the project she was awards with “Supernova” of the team. An excellent team player and a must have in all the teams. Garima is sincere  proactive & hardworking. She was seen stepping up from time to time with a lot of passion. Despite of work pressure  she remained flexible with work timings & she has a hunger to learn as much as possible. Commitment and dedication towards the project - Detailed analysis and thorough understanding of the system requirements.
Girish always looks for innovation - For instance As a part of brand implementation we do a feed validation task(received from external systems) for client to identify if the feed is correct in all respect(syntax  requirement  logical relation  architecture point of view) for consumption of framework. There are plenty of parameters on the basis of which the feed is evaluated. Girish came to me and our project architect with idea to automate this to maximum extent and parallely working on this using node Js and angular. It was utilized for basic level information of received feed and in progress as of now still want to highlight his intent.
Girish is a confident man with great enthusiasm for work and played a vital role in the Westmore Beauty brand launch on Mountain framework. Prior to this project we looked at Girish primarily as a backend resource only but the way he delivered the UI rich most complex requirement of the brand i.e. SAS page it changes our opinion on his capabilities and he gained confidence of senior team members. I think he is a succes story of SFCC full stack training program becuase he worked as a full stack developer in Westmore brand since beginning and as an only developer in last stage of the project. Apart from this  he always looks for innovation - For instance As a part of brand implementation we do a feed validation task(received from external systems) for client to identify if the feed is correct in all respect(syntax  requirement  logical relation  architecture point of view) for consumption of framework. There are plenty of parameters on the basis of which the feed is evaluated.

True leadership lies in guiding others to success. In ensuring that everyone is performing at their best   doing the work  they are pledged to do and doing it well. I have got a chance of working with such kind of leadership and Hemant is perfect example of this. MCM team and Demandware both were new for me. But when I joined MCM  Leadership provided me such a positive environment that helped me in learning the new technology. He always spreads positive vibes in the environment which helps in team bonding. He always ensures that everyone in the team is having high moral. He is Supportive  Approachable and always take care of his team. He provides his valuable inputs where required but most importantly enables the team to take ownership and lead on their own that help is unlocking people's potential to become better. He believes in your capabilities and will never fail to recognize. One of his qualities is that he always listens and understands to the team’s concerns and then provides his suggestions. He always gives a platform for team to handle things their own way and come up with ideas. He is source of great inspiration for the team. It’s been a great pleasure working with you. Thank you for your support and guidance.
Hemant has been a key foundational pillar of the SFCC CoE and has been instrumental in its growth over the past so many years. I have had the pleasure to work with Hemant over the last few months on several new business development opportunities namely Yamaha  Razer and L’Occitane and its been an enjoyable experience on every occasion. Hemant brings to the table the right mix of technology and business capabilities to be able to put together the right solution for every client working within the constraints of limited amount of information availability during the pitch stage. His cool demeanor and ability to stay calm  when faced with tight deadlines and multiple iterations of solution and financial reviews is worth emulating. To add to these qualities is his great people connect which makes him stand out from the rest as a great leader. All of these qualities demonstrated time and again make him a worthy contender for leadership spotlight award.
Leader is the one who creates a legacy and inspires others to dream more  learn more  do more and become more. And Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.  Hemant truly defines these lines. MCM global is the first project where I get a chance to work with Hemant. He believes in keeping the team focused on a goal and motivates the team to do their best to achieve it  especially when stakes are high and consequences really matter. He is the one who always who always provide a warming environment in team by standing back and letting team shine. I remember when I shared my interest towards BA  he is the one who told me by about QBA program in sapient and asked me to enroll in it. He treats his team as a family and takes equal care of everyone. Despite his hectic schedule  he always finds time to interact with people around him or anyone can walk up to him and discuss issues. He always provide you a solution to your problems. It’s been a great pleasure working under your guidance Hemant. Thanks for giving such a healthy environment to team MCM global. You are a rock star. Thanks for all your guidance.
Jaspreet is very good team player. He helped our team to understand SFCC. As more than half of team was new to SFCC he helped whenever we need help. I remember the day i have a ticket related to order history page. There i found concept of hooks and really i did not understand how hooks works then went to documentation page but after that also i have some doubt. I reached to Jaspreet with the problem he explained the concept of hooks very peacefully eventhough he was busy. Thanks Jaspreet for your help and support.    
Jaspreet is the core member of Pandora project and from the initial phase of the project  he started taking care of crucial deliveries with single handedly. Though whole application is new to him  not only he ramped up himself in a short span of time  but he also started contributing in giving KT sessions to other folks as well. He is the ONE who is managing China site and China modular checkout in all . Due to his continuous and pro-active way working only we were able to deliver  specific deliverables on time. His dedication toward his work  is tremendous. He has shown a great progress on all fronts.

He has exceptional knowledge on XT track and appropriately challenges assumptions and requests coming in from product owners/clients. He is a very calm and composed person and is a great leader for the team when it comes to resolving challenging situations and removing roadblocks. He is a master of juggling tasks when needed  and has been successfully completing the delivery of both MCM and Movado  despite heavy resource crunch on both the accounts. He has developed great rapport with clients  who depend on him for guidance and suggestions
Team was in crisis when earlier lead rolled off from project. Ketan has shown great maturity in last couple of month  he is helping team wherever team members stuck  doing estimation of all sprint deliverable and always picks challenging ticket to deliver in sprint. In addition to these tasks  he is managing all builds and production deployment also. He is running on right path to become true leader.
For one of the story  ihve some doubt about approch so he call me and listen my approch and give some point which may be i missed  that help me to delivery my story on time with less bugs
I would like to recognize Nadeem for core values Leadership. He always provides the best and optimistic approach to solve any problem  be it technical or functional. He always manages the project issues or delivery in an excellent manner. His support solutions to clients and other capital SFCC projects showns his deep understanding of the technology. His always helped the team by sometimes deep diving into issues thus keeping team resources happy and satisfied . Being a proactive onshore team member  he handles client pressure situations very well resulting in offshore team working more productively. As a leader  he handles all the situations in a very calm and confident manner and that help the team feeling the same. His commitment towards his work is appreciated. 
Naresh has always been one of the most dependable and commendable person in the team. Very flexible in his approach of delivery he is able to multitask really well. He comes up with a very positive attitude of getting things delivered and thus is able to manage multiple things on her plate with ease. He always loads balances task among the team and is always available for help even on weekends if required to meet timeline. I found him very dedicated  responsible and a good team leader. Work is always his first priority and is always ready to go extra miles. He is an extremely approachable person and always has a focus on improving the quality of him and team's deliverables. He goes beyond the mark and is very actively involved in activities like Test Cases Review  Code Review  Defect triage  release notes creation and other discussion.

I always like his attitude towards work and team. If any project has a person like Naresh in the team  success of project is assured. 
I would like to nominate Naresh for Leadership & CFD. He is the pillar of MCM project. He is managing  mentoring and providing guidance to the team. Always there to offer support to the team. His expertise in technical skills and excellent soft skills made him a good leader. He seems to be someone handling multiple task simultaneously and his presence brings positive vibe to the team. Whether its late night client calls or client demo  he always handle the task so gracefully and appricated by client many times.He has dilvered many complex functionality and always makes sure the task completion by team on time.You are a pillar of MCM.Keep up good work!!
He took innovative idea for svg sprite.
What is expectation of from a leader are all exhibit by Nitin. It is not necessary that only in and out of framework of SFCC is the criteria for a technical manager but Nitin ensure that people around him also learn from his expertise even person is one day old or from years in account.He ensure that all team members have positive outlook toward work. Also ensure that team should have proper outing/ team lunch to ensure that all team members have good bonding  which result in more productive output as a team  which i think is very good point.Because you give team some  cherish-able moments  team will deliver you by going extra mile. it is not some kind of lollypop to dev but doing these things he is really bonding the team well.
Opportunity comes to those who quit Waiting and start Looking. Success comes to those who quit Thinking and start Doing. That’s define the Nitin  Looking and Doing. Nitin joined Sapient in 2018 only and M&S is his second project as front-end developer. For Nitin  we can say challenges come on our way to break them. Nitin as a front-end developer was new to salesforce and he picked up project understanding quickly  and started working on completes piece of work and delivered with quality and on time of before time. He worked on two most complex piece of scope  one is PDP image layout which is too complex as compare to standard implementation he owned this end to end and delivered the story within time without re-open and no defects. Another piece is Bazar Voice which he worked with backend team which was one the important feature which he picked in the beginning of the project. Being new to technology and new to e-commerce he accepted all critical work and delivered on time ensuring quality. Nitin proved that taking up ownership and responsibility is not comes from title  he is always picked up complex work and comes of with solution. Nitin is keen learner and broken boundary of only being UI developer he learned SFCC as well also helped project to fix SFCC fixes as well  he is heading towards Full Stack developer. Thanks Nitin for all great work and your contribution to the project  Way to go!!!
I would like to nominate Nitin for Leadership Spotlight category. He is not only driving Guthy-Renker account with great leadership from long time but also creating leaders within the account. I have been leading track in Guthy-Renker from long time now and it was Nitin who identified me for this role and helped me to do this role efficiently. Not only me he has given oppurtunities to lead track to many team members(both Devs and QAs) based upon their interest and skills. Currently  he is handling 3-4 different tracks within this account. The best part is he gives you full freedom to share and implement your ideas and lead the track the way you want and at the same time silently keep tracking the projects health to ensure more involvement whenerver there is need. He always communicates to PM  Offshore team and Onshore team to follow systematic way of doing things.
A true leader not only brings out best in himself but he brings out the best in others around him as well. A true leader enables and helps others around him to grow. His vision and action inspire others to push their limits and achieve excellence. These lines perfectly describe Nitin. He pushes his team to expand their knowledge. Nitin has taken many initiatives within the team to ensure this  be it the regular knowledge transfer sessions or encouraging everyone to explore platforms like trailhead or enabling the team to participate in various training programs. Initiatives like these create huge impact because it not only allows the individual growth but also increases the overall team efficiency in the long run which results in the better delivery of the project.
Nitin is the best Manager I have met in my 4.5 years of career. He is the best source of motivation and learning for me. He guides and motivates me to learn new technologies. Nitin is the Pillar for Guthy-Renker and WBCD track. He has qualities of an excellent architect along with great Managerial skills. According to me complete credit of running GR project smoothly goes to him. Will be ready to work with him for any type of project due to his excellent guidance which will make you learn almost anything. 
"He is fantastic manager who leads his team in right direction with proper processes. He has been a complete support to the team in times of pressure and has been playing as a shield for young members. This has not only proved his ability to handle his team but also has helped the new team mates to gear up in the environment of the account. He has been a point for every one in the team to learn from experience. He has a quality to defend for his team in front of client but rather makes sure that the person rectifies it and learns from it. ""Thank you for everything""."
There were UI tasks in the Tickets where he has demonstrated innovation in such a way that fix implemented made minimized the Regression tasks that usually occurs post any UI fixes across all platforms. This is appreciable  as not only it saves time and redundant tasks also testing was done without any issues. This was done in very less time frame. 
Being a new joinee  his support really helped me to understand the project. Sometimes  I asked him same thing multiple times but he never loses his patience instead helped me everytime happily. He is also skillful and  hard worker as well.
A Leader and mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you  than you see in yourself  and helps bring it out of you.  Pradeep is the perfect example of this. Luckily  I got an opportunity to work with him in MCM account.  He is the person who has a unique and efficient way of working. Pradeep taught us  how to use Jira for LLP’s and how to log dependencies in Jira on time  so that team is always one step ahead.  Pradeep believes in growing mindset of people so he teaches the team how to manage dependencies and hurdles using DOJO tools which helps team to work in effective way. He is a perfectionist in his work. I remember an incident where I need to link a defect to a story and I did it in a reverse way. At that time  he explained me the difference by giving an example of relation between mother and child. He is a great example of how we should think from a client  stakeholder’s perspective- and drive results. He is a person who always have a practical and step by step plan to all problems. He is a born leader and always inspire a shared vision to his team  sincere desire in growing the team  encouraging people to improve continuously and leading from the front without any help. He is a process oriented person and expert in Jira and I haven’t seen any other person like him in my work span who is so clear in his thoughts and I really admire him a lot. During LLP or on floor  Pradeep always used to ask right and crisp questions and expected team to answer right and crisp answer  which in turn helped team to speed up the delivery. He believes in recognizing the good of the team and he always make sure that morale of team is always high. It’s been pleasure working with him.
Innovation is what describes this man the best. Be it over personal talks or project related stuff  he always has a unique and different view-point from the crowd. Prem has always tried to follow unconventional approaches when dealing with issues and try providing quirky ideas that might benefit clients outside of their sighted asks. He manages to go out of his routine and definite timelines to accommodate adhoc requests and never fails to be creative in his deliveries. His innovation idea was well appreciated and acknowledged by the everyone and there are other numerous big and small instances where he has offered to provide solutions and proposals that helped either ease out the delivery process or identify potential issues/risks with their system/sites. It is this magnificent attitude Prem that makes him stand high in front of our clients and definitely wins value and trust for Sapient. Thank you for your continued hard and great work.
A good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better. These lines are apt for Rachit who has been working closely with the team and continuously helping them in their growth.
Rachit has been good team player and comes forward whenever team needs his help
I would like to nominate Rajiv for Leadership and People growth because he is a great example of someone with great technical as well as great interpersonal skill. He has always encouraged the team to provide the logical inputs where required but most importantly enabled the team to take ownership and lead on their own. I have sought Rajiv's advice on various issues spanning from technical or functional and he has always given simple  extremely logical  do-able solution’s without over complicating things. Even in critical situations he never resorts to quick-fixes but rather understands the root cause and really gets to the fundamentals of any issue providing long term solutions.He has a right balance of calmness  empathy and logic to come out with positive relationship across the team.It’s been a great pleasure working under his guidance.
Rajiv is the great leader who knows the way  goes the way  and shows the way.  I got a chance to work with him in MCM support track. He believes in honesty and integrity and expects the same from his team. I want to share an incident where we were trying to replicate a defect and by mistake I lower down the price of a product to $1 as we need to place an order with actual credit card and by chance  the same price got replicated to the production and three orders got placed with $1 price. He noticed the orders on production with amount $1 and he immediately informed the client about the same and client cancelled the orders on time and that’s how we saved our client lose. Whenever  we have pressure situation in the project  he always stay calm and keep the motivation level up by providing the optimum solution to team at time. I want to share another incident where development team were struggling to find the root cause of an issue which was blocker for two days but they couldn’t find out the root cause. At that time  Rajiv looked into the issue and found the root cause in few minutes. He is the only senior manager I have ever seen in my work span who codes himself. People who works or worked with him says  “Rajiv is the best solutions architect in Sapient”. He inspires me every time in a tough situation and I really respect him for all his qualities. It’s pleasure working with him.
He is a true leader with extraordinary technical skill which helps grooming the team in the fast forward way. He has a very nice attitude towards the work and for the team  he treats everyone with due respect and gives everyone a great opportunity to grow. At times he sits with team member to actually debug the code with them   which is rarely seen at managers level in IT industry He is s true inspiration for the whole team .
He is very innovative and hard working person
Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It's about impact  influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results  influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work  and you have to inspire team-mates and customers.  Whenever I read these lines I always think about RT  his techno-philosophy creates a vision and makes you motivated to achieve the mission.  
She is very encouraging and helpful. She has the ability to encourage her team mates for stepping up  taking initiatives and reach to the level which they deserve. She has set an example of a good mentor  who always provided support people growth. A mentor who always encourages her team mates to grow  definitely deserves this recognition. She has strength to face any situations intelligently. she has not only capability to get out from worst situations in the team but also helps team members in very effective manner. She has the ability to encourage her team mates for stepping up  taking initiatives and fight for their rights and reach to the level which they deserve.
Richa has always been very particular on meeting deadlines well in-time to avoid any impacts on the client plan. I have seen Richa dedicatedly working to deliver best solutions time and again. And ever since she had been working for the Pandora project  her dedication and commitment to work has been off beat. She has always been seen doing detailed analysis to a problem and understand the root cause so as to avoid such situations in future. Richa has been proactive to set up meetings to discuss issues/concerns if any during the project. It has truly been remarkable to see such level of maturity despite going through tremendous pressure herself. Richa has been  at most places  seen working with and for the team rather than as an individual. She is one who believes that your success is through what your team achieves at the end of the day. Richa has been keen on her own growth and have been concerned for people in the team to learn and grow. When Sanjay joined fresh to the account  she had been always supportive of making him understand and become comfortable with the new framework. Also  in the process if it so happened that she wasn’t able to address the queries put forward and it was at this time that she made sure that the right person is approached to gain the required context. She has had great relations within the team whether they had been closely associated with her or not. She has always provided the comfort level so that folks can reach out to her for help and they would never get disappointed. Richa has been approachable for even the silliest of queries people would come up with  which she would still answer in a way that is satisfying for the other person. It is through all of these efforts and hard-work that has made us successful for our clients. Thank you again for your continued diligence and great work.

She is new to SFCC but the work she has done so far shows that she has a very good knowledge of SFCC. She has trained the people on front end technologies during FullStack training and is always there for helping others.
I would like to nominate Tarun for his positive influence to the team  His never-ending energy to pick things up is second to none.

Invoative in her approach   goal oriented.
Ruchi joined Coach few months back. She was a trainee from ATG. However the way she picked things is truly appreciable. Her approach is not limited to working on the tickets but also her willingness and eagerness to learn new things. She herself showed interest in working on CSS  JS and has been picking small tasks there too.She has also tried her hands on build and release management and has been doing well there too.

I have worked with Sanchit  in Southern glazers account and now we are again in the same team Movado.He is really hardworking who has already exceeded everyone's expectations being at Associate level stage.SGWS was his first project and the way he took all the responsibility of developing functional automation test suite all by himself in a very less time is commendable .Being a developer   he had been a great help to the QA team and  has led an example for the whole team by developing functional automation test suite in Mocha Chai Framework .He single handedely put all the things in place  with lesser guidance .He has later taken the initiative to get the unit test cases worked upon towards 100% coverage. I am really impressed with the dilligence and dedication he puts in to deliver quality work. He has really come through with flying colours with time and he is on his way to become a full stack developer.He has that keen urge to learn and is a fast learner  for instance he has not only learnt Mocha chai framework in less time but also implemented the same into real time project.The  test suites he made are a great help from  delivery point of view across as that can also be reused for some other SFRA based projects. Now in Movado   the development job done for managed services has been assigned to Sanchit and  he is leading it with the same enthusiasm. His zeal towards work   dedication and ingenuity is laudable. He is outperforming even at this stage and I am surehe will this promising and liable resource will prove his capabilities in future .
Sanchit is the backbone of Movado managed services. He has built a strong rapport with the client and is able to independently handle many client conversations related to his track. He has developed strong understanding and expertise on SFCC platform. He is able to work with minimal supervision  and completes his stories well within time. Essentially he is a BE+FE+QA+BA rolled into one. In addition  he manages his time well and to find time to help other people on the project.
Sandeep started Guthy account approx 1.5 years ago. Now he is strongest piller on the account. In this quater under his leadership(track lead) 2 brands were release to production on newly created Mountain-Less framework. Cutover of both brands went without hiccups  hardly any issue reported. Under his guidance and stringent review process  even during UAT  very few defects were raised by client. He proposed to pick up CR's as count of defect was less and team had available bandwidth for the same. Client appriciated it a lot and were happy to see last moment changes delivered. In parallel he is also handling development of 3 more brands implementation and all three are on track from development prespective. He not only helping mountain track but also help other tracks such as WBCD & Facebook whenever required. He is the goto person for anything related to project or any other technical query on the project.
Sandeep is the technical backbone of the team. During SmileActive launch in December  leadership was not sure if team will be able to meet unreasonable demand from client (Brand Launch during last week on December. This was supposed to start during Durga Puja vacation time). Demand was very much unreasonable in the sense that 1. Time is short in terms of known vacation planned by individuals  2. You have almost no QA for the work 3. You do not have trained developer to start the work. 4. Actual plan was translating the dates during first week on January. As technical lead  he convinced us the way he could finish the work. He took the delivery challenge. Here is what he did - 1. Single point of contact for any story - Dev  QA  integration  regression  dependency tracking  design challenge or anything on that.  2. Daily challenge to the team over quality - leading 85% FTPR 3. Immediate response on 3rd party integration challenge - He made himself as SPOC for any integration question at any team. This gave the confidence to client as well as 3rd part integrator OCX. By doing these activity  he gave the confidence for December timeline. Client was very much aware the challenge and was OK to go to Jan but Sandeep made it possible.
He is always have the positive attitude and very cool  always ready to help team and motivated us to achieve the deliverable  
He is very hardworking person. He is the one to whom people first reach out to for reporting queries  whenever they face any challenge in GR.  He is proactive in taking any responsibility and highlight risks/issues/concerns well in advance.  He is always willing to put in effort. His never denying attitude is commendable which shows his willingness towards the work he does for successful deliverables like Mountain  SA brand launch and WM launch. This is just a few accolades  you deserve much more. Keep up the good work.
Sandeep Singh plays a very critical role in Guthy-Renker team and has been doing the best of it with delivering quality work in all his assignments. He has very strong domain skills and responsible all development tasks. He has very patience when it comes to answering and helping the team members. Thank you Sandeep for your contribution  leadership and support that you have provided to team members.
This is for sandeep singh. Being an expert in Mountain/FB track  he ensure that every query asked by peer is resolved and person is completely aware of the issue which he is working upon. Apart from this  his calmness and cool attitude is what make hem Go to person for any technica/Non technical query within the team.
Sandeep is one stop person on for any type of technical need be it backend  frontend  devops anything. His high level of patience is rarely seen among leaders  I have to learn a lot from him be it technical or leadership. People at onshore see him as the best GLUE at offshore who can fix anything.
Sandeep has worked remarkably well to automate process of production monitoring. He is a good team player and sincere
Sandeep has been working with us on support track for the day 1 and has been the one and only support expert on the team. he did not have any SFCC background but with time he learnt and manages to crush all boundaries of expectations that I ever had from an individual in a team. He quietly manages his days tasks  plays a significant role in triaging and debugging production related issues  identifies code/design issues and subsequently proposes fix options  gets into solving SFCC issues  spends time on optimizing and finding out related changes  proactively identify loopholes and post that finds time to work on innovative solutions to ease his work. All this done and you will still find him running around making sure he is available to all that need his help. Amazing person to have on any team
Great improvement in self growth.
He is the youngest team member and is one of the most responsible person in the team. He is the pillar of production support. 
I have been working with Tanuj for around 3 years now. He has great team leading capabilities and his cool and calm composure all the time including tense ones. Whenever there has been any difficult situation I had found him available and supportive to rectify the issue very proactively. He brings in incredible amount of energy  has great client focus and always keeps innovating not only to improve the efficiency of team but how to make the process more efficient. He is an inspiration to work with  as he always has something to offer. He is a great PM having great skills and lots of positive energy. He always makes sure that team is well motivated  cheerful while working  he is a person to trust upon and trusts his team too. Tanuj’s supportive and calm nature really makes all issues tackled without any trouble. He works very diligently and has great potential; whatever load was put on his shoulder he never seems exhausted and made sure that all the things were executed very well. Currently he is handling two projects ANF & TPC but still I have seen him working on RFP tasks late night or even during weekends. Tanuj has been an outstanding project lead for ANF! His poise  calm under pressure  logical thinking and passion for success are all critical qualities to the success of our project. Not only he has great managerial skills  but his past technical background is a cherry on the cake. His positive energy and never dying attitude inspire the team. He maintains a good repo with the client. He always supports people not only on the professional but personal front as well. Thank you  Tanuj  for your dedication  leadership  and drive for excellence. Our project could not have been as successful without you! 
I never had an opportunity to work directly with Tarun but there are some instances where Tarun has helped us on Pandora and now he is working closely with Richa for Full stack training. What I have seen that Tarun's zeal to learn and grow is never ending  and this does not stop at himself. He always engages people in learning exercises  actively organizes sessions to share knowledge and perpetually supports colleagues in taking new initiatives and enhancing their skills. Tarun is a mentor and coach to several people who come and seek his help on a regular basis. He makes every effort to ensure that the Team's knowledge levels are current and designs plans/roadmaps with achievable goals to accelerate people’s growth. The way he connects with people is remarkable  using just the right balance of patience  empathy  firmness and logic as per the situation. He proactively reaches out to people to understand their concerns and brings it up in the appropriate forum. Thank you Tarun for helping everyone around grow!!!”
Vinod is an active leader. He takes up responsibility to lead the team. During the time I worked with him  I've seen him foster growth and development. He would work all time till the deliverable is set for delivery and would always be around to entertain any concerns or issues and always give a helping hand to anyone in need. Whenever we would get stuck we could reach out to him at any time  be in even after office hours and he would be there to help and get involved to as if it is his deliverable and put his best into it.
with Crepeerase vinod has shown attitude only a leader could hold. He is reachable and does whatever he can to find a solution
I would like to nominate Vivek for Leadership Spotlight award. He is the point person in the team. He is always helpful whatever the issue is with simple solutions to complicated problems. I have learned a lot from him over the time in project. Whenever I had any problem in the project he not only helped in resolving the issue but also helped me understand the concept behind it.
He is always have the positive attitude and ready to help team and the way to explain things is so good. That I have observed since long
Abha joined Sapient and Guthy-Renker as a fresher and making impact with her dedication on assigned tasks. I would like to nominate her for client impact for detailed feed analysis task she did within the time limits. When I assigned her the task to validate Westmore brand feeds as per framework guidelines she not only worked well in that task but also completed that one day before than what was expected by putting extra effort and utilizing after office time. We already received that feed late from client and So  her effort saved time and helped us to move things faster from our plate in project execution.
I have known Abha since a long time since we were hired together.She is very helpful and hard-working and has proved it in GR Project.I would like to recognise her efforts.
Abha helped me alot while we both were working in CrepeErase brand in GR Project. She helped in every step as I was new in the project.I would like to appreciate her continuous dedication and hard-work.
People who are passionate about working for their organization spread this excitement to customers  this is what I feel describe about “Abhishek Mishra” M&S  is well known account within the organization  and most of us are aware it was almost at closed state when we got new small piece of work of M&S International SFRA Migrations. There is no doubt that it was Abhishek who turned it in to positive  with his in-depth knowledge of SFRA and positive insight of work and value addition of this implementation for business  same has been stated by Sam Sibbert  M&S Client during his first visit to India after this project kick-off. Some quotes of client for Abhishek-  “Abhishek instantly became a leader within my already established development team. His knowledge and clear architectural vision was articulated well making him a trusted advisor to me and a mentor to many of the engineers  both junior and senior. He has instigate change in how M&S approaches development  their coding standards and ensuring that technical debt is tackled proactively.” Since beginning of this project till Go Live  there were lots of challenges  not clear scope definition  no clear delivery processes  working collaboratively with M&S Development team where client was difficult to accept the changes in processes. This project not only delivered successfully but this small bid has given a path Publicis Sapient to spread the horizon within SalesForce as we already got one year retainer contract for SFRA enhancement support and SFMC implementation for 29 markets. The architecturally it was designed to have most of re-suable frame-work which we can leverage for further roll-outs. Abhishek  as and overall architect for the project/account not only focused on delivery but also grown most of the developers who worked or working in the project and giving them engineering mindset as he proved him-self a successful Full Stack in this project. Abhishek’s Commitment and flexibility towards his delivery is commendable which is setting up and example for the team as well.
Abhishesh is new to MCM team but in this short spam he made a place in everyone’s heart. He is an excellent full stack developer and have good knowledge of SFCC.  His strong knowledge of SFCC helped team to resolve issue before time. He took negligible time to pick up things in MCM and because of which almost everyone in the team appreciates his way of working. Abhishesh is very sincere towards his work and any work assigned to him  he completes it with full liability and enthusiasm. He is always eager to learn to new things. Its pleasure working with him. He is really an asset to team. Keep rocking Abhishesh!!
I have been working with Aditya for past 6-7 months. He joined MCM implementation team and covered up and learned Sapient QA process  Jira and the functionalities of MCM sites very quickly. MCM is not an easy project. With 25+ locales  10+ payment methods  3 Regions and multiples languages  it’s not easy to have the knowledge of each and every site  but Aditya managed to learn about all modules of each MCM site in a very short span of time. He also found and raised critical  major defects for the major functionalities of the site. He stayed late in the office multiple time to meet and keep the execution on track. I can remember he stayed late in office on his birthday and made sure the build is deployed without any defect. He is a quick learner and a hard working person. Keen to learn new things and new functionalities. He trained himself in the automation tool CATS and became an expert in automation. He is also and expert of selenium automation and always shows his skills in many automation challenges that we face. It’s really nice to work with him and I wish good luck to Aditya for doing the great work!! :o)
I would like to recognize Aditya for Client Focus Delivery. He is a dedicated person in MCM QA track who always ready to help others and put best from his side.He is also working on automation tool and able to handle multiple task. One of the fine example is  when QA lead was on leave  Aditya nicely handled the multiple things like Funtional testing Test case execution  UAT etc.  He never step back when it comes to put hard work to meet the project deliverable.  Keep up good work!! 
Aditya is a key QA contributor in MCM R2 track .He is a simple and amazing person whom everyone wants to work. He is meeting the expectations of everyone in the team.  He always ensures the delivery of project on time with good quality. He is proactive in raising the queries and dependencies on time after analyzing the functionality. He is always ready to take any changeling functionalities and refines it with quality. He understands the full context very calmly and investigate the impact and then plans the testing strategy. He is the only responsible person who single handedly tested all emails of MCM-UK site with upmost quality. He has a strong impact on the project. It’s really wonderful to work with him. 
"It gives me great pleasure to recognize his hard work  from the last few months we had multiple projects going live in short span of time. Aijaz being the QA in our team has put lots of efforts in regression and testing issues multiple times. He is always helpful to other team members with smile. He has shown delivery excellence by timely completion of features and defects testing that help us to live multiple project live in short span. and the pace at which he has learnt also shares with others and put in tremendous hard work to get the sprint success  He is a great individual and an absolutely positive helpful team mate. it has been a great experience to work with Aijaz.

Akash joined Guthy-Renker project as Onshore Architect at a time when we were launching the first ever brand on the Mountain less framework which we developed after so many hard work. So  the seamless launch of first branch was mandatory to keep the client confidence in us. At that time  it was important that the new person joined at onshore team should be able pick things quickly. Akash not only picked up the framework quickly because of his experience and skills but also never made us feel that we are working with a guy who is new in project. With his dedication and zeal the Smileactives branch was launched smoothly. Even the VP  Digital Solutions from client's end praises him for identifying some crucial configuration issue from a third party(Order hub) day before launch.
Akash alone from onshore is handling 4 stakeholders during the day and getting answer to more than 25 people team queries answered. Beside this he takes calls during his night time to discuss many other requirement related stuff with team. Almost on every instance of any requirement  he seems most updated from code and design prespective while having any discussion with offshore members. He is even ensuring any techical or requiement related concens from offshore are conveyed propely to business. I appriciate him for being such a allarounder that handles client as well offshore dependencies/queires very well.
I would like to nominate Amrita for Client Focused delivery. She is one of the key member of our Team who is not only Business consultant but also ensuring the quality of the customizations done for Pandora. She is very first person on any account who is not just responsible for requirement closure but also ensure the testing and validation before it goes to UA. She is BA cum QA on Pandora. Such setup for her was appreciated by clients and BA Leadership. She is also very strong in customer liaising. She is good in measuring the end to end impact even for a small requirement and always ensures to make a closure on requirement. Whenever a complex requirements comes in  Amrita is always one of the first to volunteer to help to get the job done. She is equally good in mentoring new people and has spread the knowledge across team. Amrita is always open to learning new things and is ready to take more responsibilities.

She is always on top of client queries and helping them to answer on time. Getting sign-off from client is always difficult. Anisha follow ups  explains the scenarios very well for timely sign-off in every sprint and situations are better than before. 
Anisha is an integral part of the MCM QA track.

She has a very positive attitude and brings positive vibe in the team which helps in team bonding. She always takes the responsibility of work completion on time and with good quality. While testing any defect she always connects with developer to understand the cause of the issue and its fixes. In addition  she has a good understanding of technology as well. She has knowledge of each functionality of the Sites whether its Checkout  Job execution  Content etc. for any complex functionality team connect with her and she always ready to guide the team members. For any adhoc task whether its client demo  client calls or build handover to client  she always ready to accept new challenges and deliver it before deadline. Thank you Anisha for all of your work in MCM and you are a key member of MCM project. Keep up good work!!
Anisha’s impact is visible whenever we have to give a client demo  handover client builds or doing anything with checkout. She is like all over the place and with utmost quality. Her passion towards suability of checkout is commendable. Anisha is a dedicated team member and very productive with great analytical skills  I have worked with Anisha in MCM Global for a short duration but her impact in the team was truly appreciated. She is a focused person and has an ability to complete the task with quality and on time. A fine example of her perfection and eye to details were demonstration when she pen down multiple question and queries the very next day she join the project wrt requirement and clarification. Her sincere hard work and knowledge has always impressed me and people around. She always meets to her work deadlines and always ready to accept new challenges let it be build follow ups or Automation. I put her in any role any task and any situation  she always sail though the same gracefully. When we started automation testing in MCM the target was to do sanity automation which have few days of efforts to which he agreed but the speed with which she produce the first piece and with quality amazed me and at the same time made me greedy. I asked her to expand the sanity suite and go for a regression suite without informing anyone  but keeping other task and responsibility same. it was too tough for anyone to keep working as manual QA and still deliver the automation piece within same time frame. Its due to her efforts that we are way ahead in Automation. From the day Anisha has joined MCM Global project in Salesforce Commerce Cloud SCG she is most recognized and praised person. It is commendable to see QA challenging the development team for any negligence that caused quality issues in the feature set of the product. She has been very diligent in ensuring that all functional aspects are covered in all the artifacts that SapientRazorfish is delivering to the client. She is not hesitant in reaching out to any level in escalating issues concerning the quality. She has very positive attitude & approach towards her work and always maintains a very cordial atmosphere within the team. It is a pleasure to have such a dedicated  talented & detail oriented person working in such a huge project. Thank you Anisha for your hard work & commitment

I would like to nominate Anmol for client impact category as we has made great impact in just one year of association in Guthy-Renker project. His curiosity to learn more and leadership skills helped him to got the oppurtunity to lead Facebook Marketing Camapaign track in such a short period of time. There are frequent releases happens in the Facebook Marketing Campaign track he led due to frequent launch of campaigns in various brands which sometimes need quick fix on the same day. Onshore team has appreciated Anmol for his late night suppport in such situations. Apart from this  he always asks me to assign some work wherein he can learn more and he contributes in other track as well whenever he can.

Managing a happy client and a happy team is a rare thing one would find in any project. Shivani being the account's program manager from offshore handles different issues separately for each brand and yet keeping all of us under the same umbrella (Tapestry). Her planning for managing the bandwidth in each quarter is very commanding. I appreciate your efforts on shuffing the resources across teams so as to avoid dependencies and help your team for their individual growth path.  Keep spreading smiles Shivani :)   
Being new to the technology as well as the project he showed remarkable speed in getting all the context. Was productive in no time and was handling multiple tasks. Has been handling tasks as a pro even when the title was of a Junior Associate. He also took Knowledge sharing sessions for other people when team was expanded being the point man for all internal queries. Such is the confidence that he was preferred to support the UAT of the current project along with a lead rather than a senior person.
From the last six month  I am working with Sushen. I am impressed with his managerial and leadership skill. Let me share my story why I am nominating him. I was new to SFCC and on my first day of Project  Rakesh Assigned me Production Monitoring and Production Support task. I was not sure that I can complete the task assigned to  me and also worried because this task because it was critical and related to production at same time Sushen understand the situation and told me don't worry I can understand the situation  you are not only responsible for production monitoring and production support but also the team is responsible. This statement encouraged me to take the task and I am happy to work with him. He always takes the decisions very wisely.  He promotes team spirit. In my opinion  he is a true leader.     
Handling and managing the team is what has made an extra ordinary impact over the team.
There were QA tasks in the Tickets where she has demonstrated innovation by following testing approach which has made 100% test coverage  as without that it was not possible due to limited time and delivery deadline by client. Also finding observations and reported them quickly was very helpful in quick fix and smooth delivery of the assignment. 
Good work in QA  we were able to give high quality deliverable
I have been working with Tanuj for over 3 months and we worked together on a few new business growth opportunities for building SFCC Digital platform and managed services for Yamaha Music India and L’Occitane APAC. What stands out for Tanuj and makes him a worthy candidate for the leadership spotlight award is his ability to quickly understand client needs both stated and unstated in each RFP and play an active role in discussing the solution approach and delivery planning. Responding to RFPs is a highly skilled ask  with each opportunity being significantly different from the previous one. Very few people are able to grasp the unique requirements/business problems and tailor the response accordingly working under tough timelines in most situations. Tanuj has demonstrated this understanding consistently over multiple RFPs and moreover has also and displayed a great attitude in going the extra mile in crunch situations and juggling multiple priorities (current project commitments and new business opportunities) when there has been a need. Both of these qualities make him the right choice for the leadership spotlight award.
"Sapient team started working with Fresh from Sep'18. To start with  we were awarded the Fresh.com current site managed services work and plan was to go for the bigger project in 2019 which is to upgrade the site to SFCC SFRA version. Client wanted to see Sapient’s quality of work  commitment  work ethics on the managed services project before confirming the development project.   Rohit joined the team from start as onshore architect and front facing the client in all technical discussions  issues  questions  clarification etc. In very short span he built strong rapport with client team. He became the go-to person for them to discuss any technical issue. He has very strong Demandware knowledge which helped our team tremendously and it also helped boosting client confidence in our technical capabilities. Following are few specific examples of his contribution:  1.	During the discovery phase of the development project Rohit showed strong expertise of demandware core platform  third party integrations  known pitfalls  and best practices. All of this he explained to the client team in various forums. That helped in getting the discovery project deliverables accepted by client team without any delay or concern.  2.	There were multiple incidents where very tricky problems were found in production. Client team wanted quick solve because these were impacting live orders. Rohit was quick in analyzing such issues and providing solutions. 3.	There were some situations where our team missed to resolve few issues on-time. Rohit was able to explain the rationale and technical complexities due to which delay happened. Client team has strong trust on his technical expertise and that helps a lot in reducing unnecessary noise or escalations.  Overall Rohit has done great work on Fresh account and he should be considered for SFCC rewards and recognition for Q1.    "

My nominee brings strong assets to her role and our group is incredibly fortunate to have her as our Project Manager. First  She is dedicated and hardworking. She brings a positive high energy in our team. When I joined marc jacobs  she had developed processes and procedures over the months for managing  our project that thoroughly impressed me. This brings consistency and helps each of us to work as a team. 
Nivya is alligned to Marc Jacobs project  though it was the first project where she was assigned a role of manager  she has been performing really well in the project. She made sure there are no spillover tickets in the sprint and helped out team members wherever required. She keeps check on the requirements given to the sprints and always call out / communicate to client for missing requirements and make sure there is no slippage. She makes sure that no member in team is sitting idle and assigned with tasks. Overall i would say without any managerial experience she has done a commendable job in the project.
It’s been more than 5 years now that I have been working with Nivya in various projects. She is a true leader in every sense who leads and guides his team by creating a great work environment. Her insights and opinions are extremely valuable. Her way of planning and execution helped in delivering the Marc Jacobs SFRA project effortlessly on time. Thank You so much Nivya for being there to guide  support and inspire us.
Finding the in-depth issues  which were hard for a one to think abt.
Rahul has always been a one stop for all the technical problems. During my inital days  despite Rahul being in a separate project  he often used to sit with us through our problems even if it meant extending his work hours. We learnt a lot from him. A very good team player.
A relaxed and flexible work environment increases our team's productivity by letting ideas flow by him. He encourages an atmosphere of work to team.
Leading the project
Appreciating Shuchita Parashar for her understanding about Demandward and related technology stack. She has in and out knowledge about Coach Project Domain and the processes. She is very keen to learn new things in any given opportunity  be it build script updates or environment setup. When the Akamai-Instart project started  I was given her name as reference point for any help required and she literally proves that she is a true reference point to resolve any issues. I would like to specially mention about the flexibility & availability at any required time and no hesitation in looking problems in deeper levels to get quicker solutions.
Sonal being primary a BE developer has plaued the role of full stack in the Giaran Project and she was able to make the changes to the SDK received on the last hour to have the functionality working in the client demos. Her proactive approach resulting in giving PS side of things clear in front of clients.
Sumit has been very proactive in understanding the requirements and highlighting the missing requirement. He joined for BUXOM track of our Managed Services team and was able to handle the ever complaining client with quick updates and early callouts. The way he updates JIRA is so clear that Business never raised any concern regarding the status and started gaining confidence on the MS team  whose credibility was at stake. He has gained the client confidence over the period of time.
He is truely quick learner and problem solver.
Sanjay’s testing skills are amazing. He covers scenarios in detail and comes with scenarios not thought of as well. Having such a strong QA delivers quality project. His knowledge in Ecommerce and demandware is commendable. When we are developing afterpay module we have not consider scenarios for order-groove product and gift card. He communicated with the On-site architect and get it done how it should be.
Rohini is very dedicated to her work. Once she took any work  she did not take rest until it finished. She was very new to front end but she took much challenging tasks on JavaScript. Team members reach her for solution and she helps. I see minimum reopens/ bugs in her tickets. She explores new solutions and takes leadership in end to end completion. 
"Staffed Sanjay to manage mini-projects on the on-going Shiseido / Bare Minerals account. We did not have much expectations from him and were looking to get one QA who can focus on the new feature / enhancement worked upon and get it tested with reasonable quality.
To our surprise  he managed those mini-projects with great quality and details. He had to get the overall context on the application as well to ensure that he can validate the impacted areas as well. He managed to spend that extra time and got himself quipped. He has been very diligent in his work and you never had to look back once the task is assigned to him. He will proactively callout any challenges he faces or issues he encounters and try to mitigate. He has always been flexible to accommodate based on the work in hand. He will track all the items to closure and has shown great maturity levels in various discussions and status reports. Currently  he is able to manage two projects and ensure quality deliverables.
"
Tinu is very sharp and will grasp the project context very fast. He is one whom you tell once and then you don’t have to repeat. He has been very effective in using ATM and even client Jira for overall test and defect management. He manages the team very well and ensure that things are addressed on time and are not slipped. He will have the complete handle on the QA status and will share his plan / concerns to the project team well on time.
"Jagan has been on NARS implementation (Shiseido brand) earlier and has shown his potential by leading the QA track with numerous challenges. 
In his next stint with SalesForce  he is now playing a step-up role on Fresh. He has been holding the fort very well and is communicating the challenges / status to the project team with required information. He has got a green team with most of the members without any e-com / SFCC experience  and he is mentoring / guiding the folks to ensure that the quality is intact. Overall  he is using his e-com experience to focus and get the most value out of the testing that’s happening on ground. He has been able to manage his new team well.
"
Rajesh is a PM who wants everything to be perfect on his projects. He will plan things well in advance  call out dependencies on time  will follow-up on all the key items with the entire team to ensure that things are not slipping and any activity which impacts the overall delivery / timelines - people are informed well in advance and discuss it to get the corrective measures to reduce the impact. His reports are through and he will reach out to all the stakeholders with open dependencies to ensure that things are aligned with the overall plan.
Umesh has been a pillar on various Shiseido accounts and is currently fighting the Mobify battle. On Mobify he has spent sleepless nights to get the green team up to speed. Though  as a program we are delayed and catching up  but his attitude of taking up the challenge and taking the team along to deliver is remarkable. He has shown that you throw him any challenge  he is ready to handle.
